I’d like to build an AI-powered education app, designed to be a personalized learning companion for students of all ages. The app would use an LLM to provide real-time tutoring in subjects like math, science, and language, adapting explanations to each student’s learning pace and style. Key features would include: AI-generated practice problems based on curriculum standards, natural language Q&A support where students can ask follow-up questions like they would with a real tutor, and visual step-by-step problem solving to reinforce concepts.

## Notes

I had a challage in navigating in the XCode because it was my first time using this program.
